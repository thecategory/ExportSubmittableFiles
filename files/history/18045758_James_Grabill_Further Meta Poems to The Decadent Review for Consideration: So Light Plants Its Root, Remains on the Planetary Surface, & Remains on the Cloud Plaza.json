They\u2019re fantastic.</p>\n<p>I particularly liked the \"So Light Plants Its Root\u201d series, with the Rothko, Klee, Pollock, Graves refractions. It\u2019s interesting both conceptually and&nbsp;corporeally, with the stanzas striking hard. It\u2019s a pleasure to read.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a private link to an online draft:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thedecadentreview.com/corpus/so-light-plants-its-root/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link-color sbm-text link accessible-link\">https://thedecadentreview.com/corpus/so-light-plants-its-root/</a></p>\n<p>We\u2019re trying to conform to the copyright restrictions, so I have a Klee\u2019s \u201cHesitation\" as top art, with the others being a bit too strict for us (otherwise I would have probably included the other masters in the piece as it unfolds - alas we\u2019ll have to settle for that Klee).</p>\n<p>Please let me know what you think.</p>\n<p>As for the other poems, we can slowly trickle those in in the next months.</p>"}, {"date": "2021-02-27T18:54:2", "message": ""}, {"date": "2021-02-27T18:54:4", "message": "None"}]}
