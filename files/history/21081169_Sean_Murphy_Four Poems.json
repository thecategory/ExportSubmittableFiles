Are those four in sequence? Asking because I... like them all.

I'll continue this by email (as registered on Submittable) with what I have in mind.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'm a bit obsessive for Moby Dick (you know how it is, I suppose), just to say, but you somehow hit all the ducks in the row with the rest of them...
