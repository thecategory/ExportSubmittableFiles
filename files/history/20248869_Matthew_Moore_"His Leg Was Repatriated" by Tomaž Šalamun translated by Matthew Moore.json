MacMillan!\"</p>\n<p>That \"MacMillan\", I mean, that's ridiculous. I actually giggled. Quite a feat, all considered.</p>\n<p>All right, we'll get in touch by email, as registered on Submittable (those sometimes end up in the junk folder, for whatever reason, so check that).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n<p>D.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>"}, {"date": "2021-05-16T13:11:1", "message": "Dear Matthew Moore,<br /><br />Congratulations!

Glad, too, that \"crystallography. MacMillan!\" so struck you; I find it bafflingly wonderful; it's the part of the poem that showcases \u0160alamun's talent for locating poetic force at the crossroads of images and surnames, with and without the possible allusions.</p>\n<p>This Sunday has considerably brightened with this acceptance from The Decadent Review. Looking forward to the Shostakovich feature and all its irreverent reverence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sincerely, with thanks and admiration,</p>\n<p>Matthew Moore</p>"}]}
